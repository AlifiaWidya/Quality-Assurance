## Description
Zoom is a video conferencing tool that has grown in popularity recently, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As more people rely on Zoom for communication and teamwork, it's critical to make sure the program operates dependably and satisfies users.

The goal of this quality assurance was to rank the most significant use cases for the Zoom application. We were able to create simple and succinct scenarios that can be utilized for testing and validation by using the Gherkin syntax.

## Requirements
To execute the test cases, you will need:
1. The Zoom application installed on your device.
2. An account on the Zoom platform.
3. A testing environment to execute the test cases.

## Top 10 Use Cases
The top 10 use cases for Zoom application, ordered by priority, are:
1.  Video Conferencing
2.  Screen Sharing
3.  Recording
4.  Chat
5.  Breakout Rooms
6.  Audio Conferencing
7.  Virtual Background
8.  Setting
9.  Security 
10. Mobile App

For each use case, we provided a Gherkin scenario that describes the behavior that should be expected from the application. These scenarios can be used as test cases to validate the application's functionality.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you can simply clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone <Link repo>
```
Once you have the repository on your machine, you can explore the use cases in the **_features_** directory.

## Usage
The Zoom program can be tested using the scenarios in the features directory. These use cases can be used as a reference for manual or automated testing of the Zoom application. You may run these tests automatically and produce reports on the test results using a testing framework like Cucumber.

## Contributing
Please fork the repository and send a pull request with your changes if you would want to contribute to it.

## Credits
These use cases were created by Alifia, inspired by the "Take Home Challenge Submission [SQA]" given by Datasaur.ai.
