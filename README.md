## Description
Zoom is a video conferencing tool that has grown in popularity recently, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As more people rely on Zoom for communication and teamwork, it's critical to make sure the program operates dependably and satisfies users.

The goal of this quality assurance was to rank the most significant use cases for the Zoom application. We were able to create simple and succinct scenarios that can be utilized for testing and validation by using the Gherkin syntax.

## Top 10 Use Cases
The top 10 use cases for Zoom application, ordered by priority, are:
1.  Video Conferencing
2.  Screen Sharing
3.  Recording
4.  Chat
5.  Breakout Rooms
6.  Virtual Background
7.  Audio Conferencing
8.  Setting
9.  Security 
10. Mobile App

For each use case, we provided a Gherkin scenario that describes the behavior that should be expected from the application. These scenarios can be used as test cases to validate the application's functionality.
